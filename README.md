# VISUAL-RECOGNITION-OF-TEXT-MESSAGES-TO-COMMUNICATE-WITH-VISUALLY-IMPAIRED-SUBJECTS
This project manages the challenges faced by visually impaired subjects by implementing handwritten text recognition and converting it to a speech that can be easily understood by the users. This ensures that visually impaired users can easily understand the written text independently.
